## Roadmap Principles

This roadmap adheres to the following principles:

1. **Customer Value First**: Every epic and story is tied to user value (comprehension, navigation, engagement)
2. **Ruthless Prioritization**: MVP focuses on essentials only; defer depth to Phase 2 and community to Phase 3
3. **Risk-Aware**: Critical risks are addressed proactively; contingency plans are ready
4. **Metrics-Driven**: Success is measured quantitatively (Lighthouse, analytics) and qualitatively (user feedback)
5. **Sequenced for Maturity**: Build foundation (MVP) → Add depth (Enhancement) → Scale (Growth)
6. **No Placeholders**: All epics have acceptance criteria; no "TBD" or "TODO" in final roadmap
